Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, [[ECML PKDD]] being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to \\'\\'reproduce known\\'\\' knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously \\'\\'unknown\\'\\' knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\\n\\n=== Optimization ===\\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some [[loss function]] on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Le Roux |first1=Nicolas |first2=Yoshua |last2=Bengio |first3=Andrew |last3=Fitzgibbon |title=Improving First and Second-Order Methods by Modeling Uncertainty |encyclopedia=Optimization for Machine Learning |year=2012 |page=404 |editor1-last=Sra |editor1-first=Suvrit |editor2-first=Sebastian |editor2-last=Nowozin |editor3-first=Stephen J. |editor3-last=Wright |publisher=MIT Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPQx7s2L1A8C&q=\"Improving+First+and+Second-Order+Methods+by+Modeling+Uncertainty&pg=PA403|isbn=9780262016469 }}</ref>\\n\\n=== Generalization ===\\nThe difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.

Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The [[bias–variance decomposition]] is one way to quantify generalization [[Errors and residuals|error]].\\n\\nFor the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to [[overfitting]] and generalization will be poorer.<ref name=\"alpaydin\">{{Cite book |author=Alpaydin, Ethem |title=Introduction to Machine Learning |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoma00alpa_0 |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |place=London |isbn=978-0-262-01243-0 |access-date=4 February 2017 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\\n\\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time]]. There are two kinds of [[time complexity]] results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\\n\\n== Approaches ==\\n\\n{{Anchor|Algorithm types}}\\nMachine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system:\\n* [[Supervised learning]]: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] inputs to outputs.\\n* [[Unsupervised learning]]: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ([[feature learning]]).\\n* [[Reinforcement learning]]: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as [[Autonomous car|driving a vehicle]] or playing a game against an opponent).

Through [[Mathematical optimization#Computational optimization techniques|iterative optimization]] of an [[Loss function|objective function]], supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mohri |first1=Mehryar |last2=Rostamizadeh |first2=Afshin |last3=Talwalkar |first3=Ameet |title=Foundations of Machine Learning |date=2012 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=9780262018258}}</ref> An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.

The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.

Here, each circular node represents an [[artificial neuron]] and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.]]\\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or [[Connectionism|connectionist]] systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the [[biological neural network]]s that constitute animal [[brain]]s. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\\n\\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"[[artificial neuron]]s\", which loosely model the [[neuron]]s in a biological [[brain]]. Each connection, like the [[synapse]]s in a biological [[brain]], can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a [[real number]], and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a [[weight (mathematics)|weight]] that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\\n\\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a [[human brain]] would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from [[biology]]. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[machine translation]], [[social network]] filtering, [[general game playing|playing board and video games]] and [[medical diagnosis]].\\n\\n[[Deep learning]] consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network.

Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, [[leaf node|leaves]] represent class labels and branches represent [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]s of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically [[real numbers]]) are called regression trees.

In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the [[kernel trick]], implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\\n\\n[[Image:Linear regression.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Illustration of linear regression on a data set.]]\\n\\n==== Regression analysis ====\\n{{Main|Regression analysis}}\\nRegression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is [[linear regression]], where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as [[ordinary least squares]]. The latter is often extended by [[regularization (mathematics)]] methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in [[ridge regression]]. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include [[polynomial regression]] (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Christopher|title=Tutorial: Polynomial Regression in Excel|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~cstevens/301/Excel4.html|website=facultystaff.richmond.edu|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref>), [[logistic regression]] (often used in [[statistical classification]]) or even [[kernel regression]], which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the [[kernel trick]] to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\\n\\n==== Bayesian networks ====\\n{{Main|Bayesian network}}\\n[[Image:SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg|thumb|right|A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet.]]\\n\\nA Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic [[graphical model]] that represents a set of [[random variables]] and their [[conditional independence]] with a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform [[inference]] and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like [[speech recognition|speech signals]] or [[peptide sequence|protein sequences]], are called [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called [[influence diagram]]s.\\n\\n==== Genetic algorithms ====\\n{{Main|Genetic algorithm}}\\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a [[search algorithm]] and [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] technique that mimics the process of [[natural selection]], using methods such as [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] and [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] to generate new [[Chromosome (genetic algorithm)|genotype]]s in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.

Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. [[Overfitting]] is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. [[Algorithmic bias]] is a potential result from data not fully prepared for training.\\n\\n==== Federated learning ====\\n{{Main|Federated learning}}\\nFederated learning is an adapted form of [[distributed artificial intelligence]] to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users\\' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, [[Gboard]] uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users\\' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to [[Google]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html|title=Federated Learning: Collaborative Machine Learning without Centralized Training Data|website=Google AI Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>\\n\\n== Applications ==\\nThere are many applications for machine learning, including:\\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\\n* [[Precision agriculture|Agriculture]]\\n* [[Computational anatomy|Anatomy]]\\n* [[Adaptive website]]s\\n* [[Affective computing]]\\n* [[Banking]]\\n* [[Bioinformatics]]\\n* [[Brain–machine interface]]s\\n* [[Cheminformatics]]\\n* [[Citizen science]]\\n* [[Network simulation|Computer networks]]\\n* [[Computer vision]]\\n* [[Credit-card fraud]] detection\\n* [[Data quality]]\\n* [[DNA sequence]] classification\\n* [[Computational economics|Economics]]\\n* [[Financial market]] analysis<ref>Machine learning is included in the [[Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)#Curriculum|CFA Curriculum]] (discussion is top down); see: [https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/study-session/2020-l2-ss3.ashx Kathleen DeRose and Christophe Le Lanno (2020). \"Machine Learning\"].</ref>\\n* [[General game playing]]\\n* [[Handwriting recognition]]\\n* [[Information retrieval]]\\n* [[Insurance]]\\n* [[Internet fraud]] detection\\n* [[Computational linguistics|Linguistics]]\\n* [[Machine learning control]]\\n* [[Machine perception]]\\n* [[Machine translation]]\\n* [[Marketing]]\\n* [[Automated medical diagnosis|Medical diagnosis]]\\n* [[Natural language processing]]\\n* [[Natural language understanding]]\\n* [[Online advertising]]\\n* [[Mathematical optimization|Optimization]]\\n* [[Recommender system]]s\\n* [[Robot locomotion]]\\n* [[Search engines]]\\n* [[Sentiment analysis]]\\n* [[Sequence mining]]\\n* [[Software engineering]]\\n* [[Speech recognition]]\\n* [[Structural health monitoring]]\\n* [[Syntactic pattern recognition]]\\n* [[Telecommunication]]\\n* [[Automated theorem proving|Theorem proving]]\\n* [[Time series|Time series forecasting]]\\n* [[User behavior analytics]]\\n* [[Behaviorism]]\\n{{colend}}\\n\\nIn 2006, the media-services provider [[Netflix]] held the first \"[[Netflix Prize]]\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%.
